Maximizing Your Free Dice Rolls
Once you‚Äôve collected your free rolls, the next step is to maximize their value. Here are some tips on how to use your rolls efficiently:

1. Save Rolls for Special Moments

It can be tempting to use your rolls as soon as you get them, but try to save them for special moments when they can make a bigger impact. For example, you can save rolls for in-game events where the rewards are greater or when you have a specific goal in mind.

2. Use Rolls for Card Collecting

One of the best ways to use your dice rolls is to try and collect cards. Many players focus on rolling dice to get cards that complete sets. Once you have a complete set, you‚Äôll unlock rewards, which will help you progress faster in the game.

3. Don‚Äôt Waste Rolls on Low-Level Players

If you‚Äôre using rolls to attack or raid other players, make sure you target those who have more resources. Attacking lower-level players may not yield enough coins or items, so try to aim for stronger opponents to make your rolls more worthwhile.

4. Focus on Village Upgrades

Rolls can be used to help upgrade your village, which is key to progressing in Dice Dreams. Save up rolls for when you need a large number of coins to upgrade or unlock new features in your village.

5. Maximize Rolls During Events

During special events, your rolls may have increased value. Keep an eye out for events where you can earn bonus rewards, or when the chances of getting rare cards or items are higher.

Risks and Scams: What to Watch Out For
While there are plenty of legitimate ways to earn free rolls in Dice Dreams, there are also scams and misleading offers. Be cautious when encountering the following:

Never share your Dice Dreams account details with anyone, even if they promise you free rolls. Dice Dreams will never ask for your login credentials. Sharing your account details puts you at risk of hacking.
